#API Web Dashboard

This is an informational dashboard I built using Sinatra. All information comprising the dashboard comes from Web APIs.

I used Behavior Driven Development for this project, starting with user stories, then writing a test, the writing code to make that test pass.

This was mainly an exercise for me to practice reading API documentation, parsing resources provided by Web APIs, and writing tests for interacting with external resources.
